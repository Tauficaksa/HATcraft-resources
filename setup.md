# This is how should setup the project on you machine

1. Well you gotta start by install Godot Version 4.2.2 (the mono version)
   1. If you cant find the specific version, contact one of the devs.
2. If you don't have vs code then I dont know what your doing in your daily life but go install it! If you dont like VS Code you can use anything else but we don't know how it will work or how to set it up so don't ask us.
3. Now install These VS Code Extensions:
   1. C# (ms-dotnettools.csharp)
   2. C# Dec Kit (ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)
   3. .NET Install Tool (ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime)
   4. Godot Tools (geequlim.godot-tools)
   5. C# Tools for Godot (neikeq.godot-csharp-vscode)
4. Well, the godot setup is done, time to clone the project from git and copy/paste some code.

If everythign went alrgith, you should run the project and check if you are getting the message "This Is Bizzar" In your output screen.
